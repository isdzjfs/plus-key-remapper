/**

 * Uses a broad filter because OxygenOS does not expose a stable tag-only filter
 * for this hardware event. Android grants full-device log access per reader
 * session, so seeing this app's own lines only is not enough to prove that the
 * user approved the system dialog. The watcher confirms the session as soon as
 * it sees a threadtime-formatted line emitted by another process.
 *
 * Also tracks the foreground package by parsing ActivityManager "Displayed"
 * and "START" lines from logcat. This is the only reliable zero-permission
 * method to identify the foreground app on Android 10+ (getRunningAppProcesses
 * only returns the caller's own process since Android 10).

     * Once the elapsed time since the first DOWN logcat line exceeds this value,

     *
     * Why this matters (the tap vs long-press race):
     *
     * OEM hardware (OnePlus/OPPO) emits one logcat repeat line every ~180 ms while
     * the key is physically held.  Each line used to reschedule the UP runnable by
     * another RELEASE_PAUSE_DUAL_MS (600 ms), pushing it indefinitely into the future
     * as long as the key was held.  That was correct for long presses but caused a
     * false long-press for taps: a tap's last repeat line at ~184 ms delivered UP at
     * ~784 ms — after LONG_PRESS_MS (700 ms) already fired.
     *
     * Fix strategy — cap rescheduling at LONG_PRESS_MS_CAP:
     *
     *  • For TAPS  (physical hold ≪ 700 ms): the OEM emits 1-2 lines before the
     *    user releases.  The last line arrives at ~184 ms.  184 ms < 700 ms cap, so
     *    the UP IS rescheduled to 184 + 600 = 784 ms.  Meanwhile LONG_PRESS_MS in
     *    DetectorService is set to 850 ms (> 784 ms), so the UP always beats the
     *    long-press timer → correct single-tap dispatch.
     *
     *  • For LONG PRESSES (physical hold ≥ 850 ms): lines keep arriving every ~180 ms.
     *    At ~700 ms elapsed the cap kicks in: no more rescheduling.  The last UP posted
     *    before the cap fires RELEASE_PAUSE_DUAL_MS (600 ms) later — i.e. somewhere
     *    around 700 + 600 = 1300 ms — well after the long-press action at 850 ms.
     *    The longPressRunnable fires at 850 ms first → correct long-press dispatch.
